To get NiL to run you will need:
* SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_mixer         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
* SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
* SDL_image         http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
* zlib              http://www.zlib.net/
* libpng            http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/
* freetype          http://www.freetype.org
* scons     >=0.96  http://www.scons.org
* NiL               You have it :) or http://NiL.sourceforge.net


 **************************
 * Installing from binary *
 **************************

No, you don't want to be installing NiL just yet, but here is a
short guide to get it running from the binary package:

* Install the libraries listed above and if you are lucky your
  distribution provides something to do that for you.
* Unpack the nil-binary-*.tar.bz2 tarball.
* Run: ./nil
* Read the section "Running NiL"

 ************************************
 * Installing from source for linux *
 ************************************

* Install the libraries listed above and if you are lucky your
  distribution provides something to do that for you.
  Note: You also need the headers, not only the libraries!
* Unpack the nil-*.tar.bz2 tarball
* Go to the NiL source directory change to nil and do the normal
  ./configure && make OR type "scons". Both methods should leave
  an executeable in the next nil directory (mine is: ~/nil/src).
* Run: ./nil
* Read the section "Running NiL"

 ************************************
 * Installing from source for win32 *
 ************************************

For instructions on how to compile Nil from source on Win32, please see the HOWTO.win32 file

 ********************************
 * Creating your own .lump file *
 ********************************

* If you did not already built the cpio-maker, go into the
  utils/cpio-maker and type "scons"
* Go back into NiL's base directory and type
  ./utils/cpio-maker/cpio-maker default.lump data
  This will generate a default.lump
* Copy the file into the same directory where your binary
  lies in, so NiL can find it.

 ***************
 * Running NiL *
 ***************

To just run nil just use "./nil" this will start a client
and also fork off a server.

You can also run a dedicated server with ./nil mode=server and
then connect to it from a machine somewhere using
./nil mode=client server=nilserver.domain.org

If you move the data file (default.lump) around then you can
tell nil where to find it with data=/usr/share/nil/default.lump

You can put all these options in a file (~/.nilrc) and nil will
use that as default.

Every time NiL is run it saves all the configuration options to
~/.nilrc.last_good this file is commented and holds all the
options that nil understands, once you have run nil once go and
read this file to see what options NiL supports.

 ***********************************
 * Running NiL with teams and bots *
 ***********************************

Start the game with e.g.:

"./nil mode=clientserver game_mode=teamplay team=0"

To add a some enemies do:

"./nil mode=bot player_name=theDude team=2 &"
"./nil mode=bot player_name=MrSmith team=2 &"

And I'm pretty sure you wont stand a chance, unless you invite a few friends :)
